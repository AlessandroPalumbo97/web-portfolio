            My Name is Alessandro Palumbo and I was born in Milan in 1997. I
            like to call myself a "nerd", but i have many habits and i love
            technology, videogames, 3D print and much more :)

            In July 2020 I got my degree from European Institute of Design of
            Milan in Media Design. There, I started showing interest in design,
            photography, videoediting, 3D print and a bit of robotics.

            Education

            I made a lot of different experiences through these years of life,
            but I still feel like my journey is at the beginning :).
